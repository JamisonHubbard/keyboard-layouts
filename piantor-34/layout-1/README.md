# Piantor 34 v1

![Piantor 34 v1 Layout](layout.png)

This layout is my second and current layout. 
This layout uses "toggle on" layer keys as opposed to "momentary" layer keys, meaning I can simply tap a layer key and that layer will be activated until I tap a different key to move to another layer.
Other notable features are the Colemak-DH inspired layout, the homerow mods for Super and Alt, the hold behaviors for '/', '.', and ',' keys on the default layer, and the sticky keys for Shift, Control, and Alt.

### Layers
- L0: Default/Letters Layer
- L1: Symbols Layer
- L2: Arrows/BT Layer
- L3: Numbers/Media Layer

The layering system in this layout takes inspiration from Ben Vallack in order to create some ease when navigating the layers on the keyboard.
The various layers are connected as follows:

This layering system provides some ease-of-use when navigating the layers, particularly in these scenarios:

- Every layer that's not L0 can return to L0 by pressing the 'left thumb' layer key
- Because of the first point, and the fact that the 'right thumb' layer key always goes to a layer that's not L0, tapping the 'right thumb' and 'left thumb' layer buttons in sequence (green then orange arrows) will *always* return you to L0. This movement is easy, fast, and acts as a great "reset" when you lose track of the currently active layer
- The combinations for getting to L2 ('right thumb' then 'right pinky') and L3 ('right thumb' twice) both work in *almost every* situation, except when starting from L1
